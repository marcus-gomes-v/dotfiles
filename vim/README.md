Config files for vim

## Installation
Install the config files according to the instructions in this repo's top level README.md.

## Plugins
This vim setup relies on [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin handling. If you want to use the `.vimrc` you should either install Vundle first or get rid of all the plugins declared in the `.vimrc`. 

If you decide to go with Vundle you need to install all plugins once. Simply start vim and run `:PluginInstall` to install all declared plugins.
